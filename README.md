### Abstract
[15 Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing.  This project was to build familiarity with XCode and the Swift Programming Language.  Specifically, we used the Interface Builder (IB) editor to layout view components, MVC design and flow of events for a Single View Application.
